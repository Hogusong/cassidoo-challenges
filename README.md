# Cassidoo Challenges

Each week, Cassidoo sends a newsletter, and within each newsletter is an _interview question of the week_. This repository will contain answers for those questions.

## Testing

The repository uses mocha/chai for testing. Each question folder will have one exported function that will answer that week's challenge. To test the answer, run `npx mocha [challenge-question].spec.js` in it's folder.
