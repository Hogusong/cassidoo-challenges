# What's the minimum value of an array in O(n) or less?

Given an array that was once sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum value in that array in O(n) or less.

Example:

```
[0,2,4,7,9] might become [7,9,0,2,4], with a minumum value of 0.
```
